# NotJacksonIntroduction

Basically the JacksonIntroduction but in a more elegant programming language.

And look at the [csproj](https://github.com/laurensk/NotJacksonIntroduction/blob/main/NotJacksonIntroduction/NotJacksonIntroduction.csproj) file, it's only using standard libraries, compared to 5 external libraries needed in Java land.
